## 🔧 Customization

### Processing Different PDFs
To analyze a different PDF file:

1. Place your PDF file in the project directory
2. Update the file path in `main.py`:
```python
pdf_path = "your_pdf_file.pdf"
```
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

### Modifying Output Format
The JSON structure can be customized in the `generate_structured_json()` method:

```python
def generate_structured_json(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Customize the output structure here
    structured_question = {
        "question_number": question.get("question_number"),
        "question": question.get("question", ""),
        # Add more fields as needed
    }
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fitz'**
```bash
pip install PyMuPDF
```

#### 2. **Permission denied when saving files**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory
- Run terminal/command prompt as administrator if needed

#### 3. **PDF file not found**
- Verify the PDF file is in the correct directory
- Check the file name matches exactly (including spaces and special characters)
- Use absolute path if needed: `/full/path/to/your/file.pdf`

#### 4. **Images not extracting properly**
- Some PDFs may have embedded images in different formats
- The script handles most common formats (PNG, JPEG)
- Check the console output for extraction warnings

#### 5. **Questions not parsing correctly**
- The parser is optimized for the provided sample format
- For different question formats, modify the regex patterns in `parse_question_from_text()`

### Debug Mode
To enable detailed logging, add this at the beginning of `main.py`:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with Sample File
The project includes a sample IMO math olympiad paper for testing:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Test with Your Own PDF
1. Replace the sample PDF with your file
2. Update the filename in the script
3. Run and verify results

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All pages processed without errors
- [ ] Images extracted and saved properly
- [ ] JSON files created with valid structure
- [ ] Question parsing accuracy acceptable
- [ ] File naming convention followed
